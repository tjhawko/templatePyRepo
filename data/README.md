## Welcome to the Data Folder README file

This file should contain information about:

* Where the data in this folder came from;
* Which scripts under the 'scripts/' directory transformed:
    * which files under 'raw/' into
    * which files under 'cleaned/' and 'processed/'
* Why each file under 'cleaned/' exists
    * include references to particular notebooks where appropriate

Overall, the goal of this README is to ensure that is is 100% clear what the authoritative data source is, and how it turned into your model's inputs.
