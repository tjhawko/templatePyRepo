## Welcome to the README File for this Project!

## General Info about this Repo Template

This template exists to give guidance on how to create a well-structured, production-ready Python project that meets BAR's quality and safety standards.

The structure is designed to be exhaustive but not prescriptive, and should be tailored to the size and needs of each project.

## A Note About Results

As the purpose of this repo is source/version control, there is no folder for results or other computational artifacts.

It is recommended that results be generated on-demand and cached to a viz layer like Qlik Sense. For accessibility reasons, generated results requiring a static record should be placed in Teams/SharePoint.

## How to use this README file

The text of this README should be replaced with helpful information about your project. The audience of the file will be BAR newcomers, teammates, collaborators, code reviewers and your own future self.

This file should give the reader a solid overview of the project, how to use the repo contents, and clear direction towards additional information.

## Things to Include in the README:
